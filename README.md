##### The second project is done in order to explore the Venues of London City and understand where could be convenient or not to open a Pizza Place. 
##### The main project of my repository, that is done in collaboration with Elena Bolgiani, is a classification project in order to predict the employee attrition of a firm with machine learning algorithms.
